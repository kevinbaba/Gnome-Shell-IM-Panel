======================
 GNOME Shell IM Panel
======================

Introduction
============

This is a GNOME Shell extension for IBus. It is forked from the GJS UI implementation of IBus, and modified to work as an extension rather than a part of GNOME Shell javascript code.

This project aims to implement a new candidate panel with Shell Toolkit instead of GTK so that the candidate panel can be shown above GNOME Shell's native components (i.e. the IM notification).

Installation
============

To install this extension, just copy the whole directory to ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
